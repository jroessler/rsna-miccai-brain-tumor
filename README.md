| 01-4D-ResNet-v1             | * 4D ResNet model using 4D images<br>* take SLICE_NUMBER slices from the middle of each 3D image<br>* added some albumentation such as CLAHE, brightness, and CoarseDropout<br>* removed black pixels                                                                                                  |
| 01-4D-ResNet-v2             | differences to 01-4D-ResNet-v1:<br>* take each x-th slice from each 3D image, whereby x (e.g., 2,4,6) depends on the maximum number of slices                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01-4D-ResNet-v3             | differences to 01-4D-ResNet-v1:<br>* instead of using CrossEntropyLoss, use BCELossWithLogits and Label Smoothing                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 02-4D-EfficientNet-v2       | like 01-4D-ResNet-v2 but with EfficientNet<br>* SLICE_NUMBER: 64 (otherwise not possible)                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 03-4x3D-ResNet-v2           | like 01-4D-ResNet-v2 but with four 3D ResNets and combine their predictions                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 04-4x3D-EfficientNet-v2     | like 01-4D-EfficientNet-v2 but with four 3D EfficientNets and combine their predictions                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05-Multi-Input-3D-ResNet-v2 | like 01-4D-ResNet-v2 but with a Multi-Input 3D ResNet model which takes the four MRI types simultaneously as an input,<br>processes each input with its own layers, concatenates the output of each process and finally forward propagates the<br>concatenated output through some shared base layers. |
